# Scriptum fork (WIP)

The main goal of this project is to make Scriptum simplier by following KISS
principle, to make it easier to read and modify its source for everyone
(first at all for me. lol).

Also I want to make it much better by adding more functionality, improving
markdown templates and comments api. But at the same time I dont want to bloat
it. I will try to focus only on the essentials!

Examples temporary removed and current version don't write any files because
I want to rewrite everything from scratch!

See target template example (hand made)
[here](https://github.com/lua-rocks/object).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Rewrite everything from scratch! ðŸ˜±
  - [ ] Custom comments style.
    - [x] Remove **all** vignette tags - just use markdown in comments instead.
      First line in first comment is title; other lines for description.
    - [x] Replace `@param`, `@return` and `@unpack` tags with `>`, `<` and `@`.
      I no need any other tags!
    - [ ] Unpack (`@`) should work with params and returns in any scope.
      Like this: `> @conf` or `< @conf`.
    - [x] Square brackets for default function params and nothing for comment.
    - [x] Any function param is required by default. You don't need to
      specify this explicitly! If it has default value, then it's optional.
      Values `[]`, `[nil]` and `[opt]` are synonims to `[optional]`.
  - [x] Separate code to submodules for easier maintain.
    - [x] Document every function in each module.
  - [x] Parser
    - [x] Function returns.
    - [x] Table returns can be used for class names (type is super class).
    - [x] Store entire file in one string and use short pattern matchers
      to this string, instead of multiline search and complex extractions.
    - [x] Tables (first described table is a module).
    - [x] Multiline comments for tables/functions.
    - [x] Show warning when function argument name doesn't match with described.
    - [x] Show warning when function is not described.
  - [ ] Writer
    - [ ] [Custom markdown template](https://github.com/lua-rocks/object).
      - [ ] Table of contents.
      - [ ] Easy links for headers.
      - [ ] External and internal tables/functions.
- [x] Remove `love` (why do we need it if it's not required?).
- [ ] Suppport for OOP: inheritance.
- [ ] Add support for
    [this Atom extension](https://github.com/dapetcu21/atom-autocomplete-lua).
- [ ] Clean markdown:
    no [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) warnings.

## Style guide

These rules are not currently enforced, but they should.

- Maximum line number is **80** characters.
- `One line` **title** comments must start with **uppercase** letter.
- `One line` **parameter** comments must start with a **lowercase**.
- `One line` **any** comments must **not** have a dot or semicolon at the end.
