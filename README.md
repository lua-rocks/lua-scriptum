# Scriptum fork (WIP)

I'm not sure if I can find a time and superpowers to do all these things,
can't promise anything but I'll try ðŸ¤¡

See current examples and documentation [here](doc/README.md).

See target template [here](https://github.com/lua-rocks/object)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Find and fix bugs; improve perfomance and readability.
  - [x] 2 spaces at the end of each line is a bad idea, use `<br/>` instead.
  - [ ] File parser use `multilineSearch` 10 times but it can be used in one
    loop for all extract functions to make parsing 10 times faster! ðŸ™€
- [x] Separate code to submodules for easier maintain.
  - [ ] Document every function in each module.
- [x] Remove `love` (why do we need it if it's not required?).
- [ ] [Custom markdown template](https://github.com/lua-rocks/object).
  - [ ] Multiline comments for all descriptions.
  - [ ] Links and table of contents.
  - [ ] Returns anoniomous.
- [x] Custom comments style.
  - [x] Replace **\`** (for subpattern code) with **~**
    (because **`** is used for keywords).
  - [x] Remove **all** vignette tags - just use markdown in comments instead.
    First line in first comment is title; other lines for description.
  - [x] Replace `@param`, `@return` and `@unpack` tags with `>`, `<` and `@`.
    I no need any other tags!
  - [x] Square brackets for default function params and nothing for comment.
    - [x] Many brackets in one line causes bugs - use only first matched.
    - [x] Any function param is required by default. You don't need to
      specify this explicitly! If it has default value, then it's optional.
      Values `[]`, `[nil]` and `[opt]` are synonims to `[optional]`.
- [ ] Show doc only for external module fields.
- [ ] Throw error when function argument name doesn't match with described.
- [ ] Throw error when described argument type doesn't match with accepted !?
- [ ] Suppport for OOP: inheritance.
- [ ] Easy links for headers.
- [ ] Add support for
    [this Atom extension](https://github.com/dapetcu21/atom-autocomplete-lua).
- [ ] Clean markdown:
    no [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) warnings.

## Style guide

These rules are not currently enforced, but they should.

- Maximum line number is **80** characters.
- One line **title** comments must start with **uppercase** letter.
- One line **parameter** comments must start with a **lowercase**.
- One line **any** comments must **not** have a dot or semicolon at the end.
